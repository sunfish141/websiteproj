      <b>Strings</b> are one of the most common datatypes used in javascript.
      They are used to store and manipulate text. A string is represented by
      zero or more characters written inside quotes. In javascript, strings are
      primitive datatypes and immutable.

    <p>
      <b>Numbers</b> are another one of Javascript's most basic datatypes. These
      include any number, such as whole numbers and decimals. Numbers stored are
      subject to floating-point imprecision, meaning that their precision will
      be lost if the number becomes too precise. Unlike many other languages,
      Javascript does not define different types on numbers such as ints or
      floats.

    <h2>Booleans</h2>

    />
    <p>
      <b>Booleans</b> are values that can contain only the values 'true' and
      'false', with no other possible values. These are often used in
      conjunction with if statements, where the if statement will return a
      boolean value to the computer. They are also used when a variable needs
      only two possible values, and for controlling program flow.
